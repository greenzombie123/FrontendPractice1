            Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live
            in 2001. Our products are used by a community of dedicated
            musicians, sound designers, and artists from across the world.

            Making music isn’t easy. It takes time, effort, and learning. But

          </h4>
          <p>
            We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving
            force behind Ableton is our passion for what we make, and the people
            we make it for.

            We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided

            Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us
            use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural
            and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
            self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects
            us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge
            to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of music
            culture.

          only work on a few products and we strive to make them great.

        <p>
          Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our
          people what they need to work their magic and grow. We’ve learned that
          achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly
          diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of
          perspectives. We don’t always agree with each other, but opinion and
          debate are valued and openly encouraged.
